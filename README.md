# BRITISH-AIRLINES-Web-Scraping-Data-Cleaning-and-Sentiment-Analysis_-TASK1
BWeb Scraping, Data Cleaning, and Sentiment Analysis
Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end web scraping, data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, feature extraction, data visualization, topic modeling, and word cloud generation. Using Python, we extract and analyze user reviews, transforming unstructured text data into valuable insights.

Key Features
1. Web Scraping and Data Cleaning
Libraries Used: requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, NLTK, spaCy

Process:

Scrape user reviews from a website using BeautifulSoup.

Store the extracted reviews in a Pandas DataFrame.

Apply advanced text cleaning (lemmatization, stop word removal, punctuation removal) using spaCy.

Save the cleaned dataset as a CSV file.

2. Sentiment Analysis
Libraries Used: TextBlob

Process:

Classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative based on sentiment polarity.

Store the sentiment classification in a new column.

Visualize the sentiment distribution using bar charts and pie charts.

3. Feature Extraction
Process:

Compute review lengths (word count).

Identify reviews containing numbers using regex.

Extract unique word counts and sentence counts.

Create a numerical representation of sentiment (0: Negative, 1: Neutral, 2: Positive).

Visualize review length distribution using histograms.

4. Data Exploration and Visualization
Libraries Used: matplotlib, seaborn

Process:

Generate frequency distribution of reviews per sentiment.

Create bar charts, pie charts, cumulative distribution functions, and density plots.

Assign random categories, dates, and ratings to simulate real-world review structures.

Plot rating distributions by category.

Perform time-series analysis on review ratings.

5. Topic Modeling with LDA
Libraries Used: Gensim, pyLDAvis

Process:

Preprocess text by removing stop words and performing lemmatization.

Create a dictionary and a corpus representing word frequency.

Train an LDA model to extract latent topics from reviews.

Visualize topic relationships interactively.

6. Word Cloud Generation
Libraries Used: wordcloud

Process:

Generate word clouds for positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

Identify the most frequently used words for each sentiment category.

Skills Demonstrated
1. Web Scraping
Extracting data from web pages using BeautifulSoup.

Handling pagination and structuring scraped data into DataFrames.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text cleaning.

Using regex for pattern matching and removing unwanted characters.

Handling missing or noisy data.

3. Sentiment Analysis
Applying sentiment classification using TextBlob.

Mapping textual sentiment to numeric values for further analysis.

4. Feature Engineering
Extracting insights like review length, unique word count, and numeric presence.

Computing sentence counts and identifying named entities.

5. Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis
Creating bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and density plots.

Conducting time-series analysis on review data.

6. Topic Modeling
Implementing LDA for topic extraction.

Visualizing topic distributions with pyLDAvis.

7. Word Cloud Analysis
Generating word clouds to highlight frequent terms across sentiments.
